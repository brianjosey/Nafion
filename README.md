# Nafion
This repository contains the data, fits, and code used to determine the structure of Nafion at the surface of a platinum electrode.

# Structure
The repository is organized into five subrepositories that contain:

1. **Analysis-** summary tables and a presentation of the results.
2. **Figures-** PDFs of the best fit profiles and reflectivity.
3. **Fits-** the Refl1D output files for each fit,
4. **Refl Files-** raw Refl files from the data cleaning and reduction step.
5. **Scripts-** Python fitting scripts used in conjunction with Refl1D.

The **Analysis** folder is further divided into folders named after the experimental conditions, and an additional **Active** folder that contains the current best fit models.
